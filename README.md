# Password_Generator
Simple windows GUI to generate random numerical and passphrase's. Built in C++ using QT.

The passphrase generator uses a simple algorithm to change every third letter of a word to a random special character (Ie: $, %, ^). Taking 3 Words to make a password, and adding a random number ranging 1-200 to the end.
